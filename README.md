Fluid Dynamics Modeling : The Numerical Solution Of 2D Navier Hyperbolic Equations 

In the following paper we will consider Navier-Stokes problem and it's interpretation by hyperbolic waves, focusing on wave propagation. We will begin with solution for linear waves, then present problem for non-linear waves. Later we will derive for numerical solution using PDE's. Also we will design a Matlab program to solve and simulate wave propagation.
